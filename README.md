# Avoid the Bugs!

This is a simple but fun arcade game where you as the player avoid the
ravenous lady bugs crusing down the road.  If you can reach the water
without being hit - you win!

Playing the game is easy.  To run, simply load index.html in your web
browser.  The use your arrow keys to move up, down, right and left.
Avoid the ladybug "enemies".  If you do get hit, your player is moved
back to the beginning and you can try again.
